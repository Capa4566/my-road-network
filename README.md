# my-road-network  

## Targeted area to study
* minimum latitude: 39.84 
* minimum longitude: 116.30 
* maximum latitude: 39.97 
* maximum longitude: 116.46  

## Main Task
1. Construct a routable road network based on NetworkX 
2. Using OSMnx, make each edge at least contain "type"/"highway" and "length" 
3. Test whether the shortest path query can work correctly given arbitrarily two vertices in the road network (show the testing process in the report). 
4. Visualize your network data with at least 3 figures using arbitrary visualization tools.    

## Solution  
The process and result are shown in Report.ipynb.
